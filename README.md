Exercises and assignments from the NTNU course "Optikk Grunnkurs" TFY4195



* "Exercises" are voluntary exercises from the book Introduction to Optics 3rd edition by F. Pedrotti, L.M. Pedrotti and L.S. Pedrotti (PPP).
* "Assignments" are mandatory calculation exercises given by the course lecturer. 
* "Labs" are mandatory lab exercises. 4 in total. Labs 1 and 3 take place in an optics lab at campus, while labs 2 and 4 are numerical optics exercises. 




The majority of these codes were not strictly necessary in order to complete the tasks, but I did them to get more comfortable in numpy Python (previously I used MATLAB).
