* 19-10.py:
A script to calculate the system ray matrix for an optical representation of the human eye. System constants of a schematic eye is found from TABLE 19-2 in Pedrotti "Introduction to Optics" 3rd edition. If the eye is viewing an object from far away, the eye is relaxed with no need of accommodation. When viewing an object at near-point (~25cm), the eye is tensed and one can assume full accommodation.
