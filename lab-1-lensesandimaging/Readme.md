LAB 1: Lenses and imaging


* prep1.py
Calculates the system ray matrix "M" for two thin lenses with focal length "f" separated by distance "d". 
With an object placed a distance "sO" from the first lens, the script prints the image position "si". See problem 4a) in the pdf.

* prep2.py
Same as prep1.py but support lenses of different focal lengths, also calculates cardinal points and magnification. See problem 4b) in the pdf.
